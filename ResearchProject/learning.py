# import numpy as np
# import pandas as pd
# from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
# from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# # Step 1: Understand the Problem
# # - Assume you have a dataset with network traffic features and labels indicating congestion.

# # Step 2: Data Collection
# # - Load your dataset (replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual file path).
# data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# # Step 3: Feature Engineering
# # - Assume 'throughput', 'latency', and 'packet_loss' are relevant features.
# features = data[['throughput', 'latency', 'packet_loss']]

# # Step 4: Labeling
# # - Assume 'congested' is the label indicating congestion.
# labels = data['congested']

# # Step 5: Split into Training and Testing Sets
# features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# # Step 6: Model Selection and Training
# # - Use a RandomForestClassifier as an example model.
# model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
# model.fit(features_train, labels_train)

# # Step 7: Integration with Congestion Control Mechanism
# # - In a real-world scenario, you would integrate the model with the congestion control mechanism.

# # Step 8: Real-time Monitoring
# # - Continuously monitor network data and feed it into the trained model.

# # Step 9: Evaluation and Tuning
# # - Evaluate the model on the testing set.
# predictions = model.predict(features_test)
# accuracy = accuracy_score(labels_test, predictions)
# print(f'Model Accuracy: {accuracy}')

# # Step 10: Deployment (Not shown in this example)
# # - Deploy the model in a controlled environment and gradually scale up.

# # Step 11: Continuous Improvement (Not shown in this example)
# # - Periodically update the model with new data for continuous improvement.
